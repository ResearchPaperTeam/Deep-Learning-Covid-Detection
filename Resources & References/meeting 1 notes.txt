- Image dataset of covid from kaggle
- Disease is predicted in 2 ways: 
	1. Classification ( Whether Disease exists or not)
	2. Classify and Localise ( Whether it exists, and if it does, where)
- we are classifying using sigmoid function.
- binary classifier
- different training and testing algorithm
- run different models on dataset and then build their confusion matrix
- from 2000, take 1500 images for training, 500 for testing
- in data both covid and non covid images should be there
